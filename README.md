# dashboard_omicron_SH

Because of Omicron, Shanghai is right now locked down. I love Shanghai because I was borned there. Also, I have seen so many informations online that is seeking for help. As a result, I want to build up a demo dashboard to monitor all those information and provide the visualization. God bless Shanghai.

Functions:

- Monitor the historical data of information since the locking down.
- Monitor the omicron data, and try to figure out what type of information is the most important topic.
